Going to the Grocery Store,"Sometimes, we need to go to the grocery store to buy food. The store can be bright and have many people. I will stay close to my caregiver. We will get a cart and put our food inside. If I feel overwhelmed, I can take a deep breath. At the end, we pay for the food and go home."
My First Day at School,"I am going to a new school. I will meet my teacher and new friends. I will have my own desk and a place for my backpack. We will learn new things like reading and math. If I feel shy, it's okay. I can tell my teacher if I need help. School is a safe place to learn and play."
Visiting the Dentist,"I will go to the dentist to keep my teeth healthy. A dentist is a doctor for teeth. I will sit in a big, comfy chair. The dentist will use small tools to look at my teeth. It is important to stay still. If I am scared, I can hold a toy or squeeze my hands. The dentist helps my smile stay bright."
Sharing Toys with Friends,"When my friends come to play, we can share toys. Sharing means we take turns. I can let my friend play with my car, and then it will be my turn. If I want a toy my friend is using, I can ask, 'Can I have a turn, please?'. Sharing makes playtime fun for everyone."
What to do When I Feel Angry,"Sometimes I might feel angry. My face might feel hot and my fists might clench. It's okay to feel angry, but it is not okay to hit or yell. When I feel angry, I can go to a quiet place. I can take three deep breaths. I can also punch a pillow or tell an adult how I am feeling. This helps the angry feeling go away safely."
