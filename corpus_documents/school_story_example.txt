Going to a new school can feel a little scary, but it can also be very exciting. I will get to meet a new teacher who will help me learn. There will be other children in my class, and I can make new friends. We will do fun activities like reading books, playing with blocks, and learning about numbers and letters. Sometimes we will sit on the floor for circle time, and other times we will work at our desks. If I feel nervous, I can take a deep breath or think about my favorite things. My school is a safe and fun place to be.
